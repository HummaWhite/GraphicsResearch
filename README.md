# GraphicsResearch

This repository serves as a collection of code I've written to replicate papers (or industrial solutions without no paper) of rendering, from September 2021 when I started to work with Professor Yanci Zhang at Sichuan University for further study in rendering. While this repository may mainly concern real-time techniques, a sound basis of knowledge in physically-based light transportation simulation is ultimately indispensable and will be a long-term goal to achieve in my graphics carrier. So at the same time, I'll keep experimenting newly learnt offline approaches with my own renderer Zillum, if any.

Updates may come slow, because I still have to complete my coursework, bachelor thesis (also about rendering!), etc.

Replicated papers / methods:

- Ambient Dice
- AMD's Fidelity Super Resolution

Working on:

- Spatiotemporal Variance-Guided Filtering
